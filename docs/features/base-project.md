Implement a NextJS webapp.
Tech Stack:

- Vercel for hosting
- Supabase for Database and User Authentication
- Use React Three Fiber for rendering 3d effects and particles.

The key feature of the app is that users can log in and they will see a rainbow collor on a minimal gray background.
Every time the user clicks the button a new Unicorn should be created. The unicorn will bounce over the edges of the screen.
Every unicon should be instantiated randombly with different features, like color palette, accesories, hair style, etc.

The app should have a profile page where user can see their stats, like how many unicorns have been created.
We should preserve the unicorns created and loade them back into the screen when users log back into the application.
